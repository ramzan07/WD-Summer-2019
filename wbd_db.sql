It wouldn’t be “proportionate,” he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1142055388965212161?s=21\">said</a>, and he’s right—though that apparently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/world/middleeast/iran-us-drone.html\">didn’t bother</a> National Security Adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and CIA Director Gina Haspel.</p>\n<p>While you’d never call the man cautious, much less <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/middle-east-civilian-deaths-have-soared-under-trump-and-the-media-mostly-shrug/2018/03/16/fc344968-2932-11e8-874b-d517e912f125_story.html?utm_term=.7fa50936f9df\">squeamish about foreign casualties</a>, it’s not the first time Donald Trump has appeared that way compared to the putative “adults in the room” advising him. There are several such stories in Bob Woodward’s 2018 book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fear-Trump-White-Bob-Woodward-ebook/dp/B075RV48W3/ref=sr_1_1?gclid=EAIaIQobChMItsa_yaX74gIVAkCGCh2L6AaUEAAYASAAEgKi6fD_BwE&hvadid=295505801996&hvdev=t&hvlocphy=9007533&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t1&hvqmt=e&hvrand=17489927765572388547&hvtargid=kwd-516114689501&hydadcr=20557_10163432&keywords=woodward%27s+fear&qid=1561144806&s=gateway&sr=8-1\">Fear: Trump in the White House</a>. In April 2017, for example, after Trump becomes enraged by video of Syrian children dying from a sarin gas attack, the Joint Chiefs present him with a range of airstrike options that includes a 200-missile attack aimed at taking out the bulk of the Syrian Air Force (and almost certainly killing large numbers of Russian advisers) Trump does the smarter thing and bombs an empty runway. The night of the strike, he calls a National Security Council meeting. Woodward writes that Trump was “unusually focused on the details…. What happens if a missile goes off course?” Trump’s so concerned about it, he demands that Mattis get him a secure line to the captains of both guided missile destroyers “are your guys the best at programming the missiles?” Have we got this right? </p>\n<p>True, Woodward recounts scenes that have you wishing someone would steal the nuclear launch codes off Trump’s desk, but more than once, the president appears more restrained and less bloodthirsty than the people advising him, like Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who urges Trump to hit North Korea, saying “If a million people are going to die, they’re going to die over there, not here.” “ That’s pretty cold,” was Trump’s response.</p>\n<p>And while it’s nice that President Trump periodically steps back from the brink, it’s insane and appalling that we’ve staked so much on the instincts and whims of one eminently fallible human being. That is not the way it was supposed to work: “This system will not hurry us into war,” James Wilson told delegates to the Pennsylvania ratifying convention in 1787, “it is calculated to guard against it. It will <a href=\"http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch7s17.html\">not be in the power of a single man</a>, or a single body of men, to involve us in such distress, for the important power of declaring war is vested in the legislature at large.”</p>\n<p>From the Cold War through the Forever War on Terror, we’ve watched the emergence of a radically different regime, in which going to war is easy, frequent, and rarely debated. Lately, there are encouraging signs of resistance to that dynamic on Capitol Hill: yesterday’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/us/politics/saudi-arms-sales.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\">Senate votes</a> to rescind military assistance to Saudi Arabia’s murderous war on Yemen, Wednesday’s House <a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/848114/house-votes-repeal-authorization-use-military-force-trump-reportedly-urges-representatives-tone-down-rhetoric-iran\">vote to repeal</a> the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force, that the administration seems to think <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/multimedia/cato-daily-podcast/dubious-legal-authority-push-war-iran\">empowers the president</a> to go to war with Iran, nearly 18 years later.

There is no national security interest at stake in the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/middleeast/iran-drone-claim-hnk-intl/index.html\">downing of a U.S. drone</a> in the Persian Gulf that could come close to the <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iran/2019-06-04/what-war-iran-would-look\">costs and risks</a> <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/unforced-error-risks-confrontation-iran\">associated with</a> bombing Iranian territory and military assets. Furthermore, contrary to those in the administration that tried to encourage a U.S. strike, it is likely such an attack would be escalatory, in contrast to Trump’s strikes on Syria in 2017 and 2018. Iran has the capability to respond to nearby U.S. assets in the region, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/20/world/middleeast/united-states-war-game-sees-dire-results-of-an-israeli-attack-on-iran.html\">war games run by the Pentagon</a> going back to the Obama administration have showed even a limited attack carries a high risk of unleashing a major conflict. More troublingly, there was almost no discussion about the actual political/military objective in striking Iran: what would such an attack seek to achieve, and how were we to measure success? Wars that begin without clear answers to these questions are doomed to failure and miscalculation.</p>\n<p>The fact that there was hardly any discussion at all about getting authorization from Congress before deciding to engage in new military action against yet another country in the Middle East remains one of the most troubling aspects of this saga. Some members of the Trump administration, most prominently Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have been arguing that the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF), which granted the executive branch permission to use force against the perpetrators of 9/11, also empowers the president to take unilateral military action against Iran. For evidence, officials are cherry-picking bits of intelligence to falsely depict an operational relationship between Iran and al-Qaeda. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/06/15/bush.alqaeda/\">Sound familiar</a>? The truth is that Iran has spent years killing al-Qaeda-type militants on the battlefield. America’s close allies in the Arab Gulf states, like Saudi Arabia, actually have a much <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/documents/evidence-of-financial-links-between-saudi-royal-family-and-al-qaeda\">more</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-islam.html\">problematic relationship</a> with Sunni terrorist groups than Iran does.</p>\n<p>Trump’s maximum pressure campaign against Iran is clearly not working. Backing out of the Iran nuclear deal and ratcheting up the pressure has only made Iran more risk acceptant and antagonistic. The Obama administration’s diplomacy with Iran got Iran to forfeit 98 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium and significantly roll back all elements of their nuclear program while opening up their country to intrusive international inspections. This approach also opened up diplomatic channels with Iran that helped improve Iranian behavior with respect to U.S. interests, as exemplified by the incident in which U.S. sailors in the Persian Gulf accidentally went into Iranian waters and were consequently captured, but then promptly released because Secretary Kerry had a direct channel to Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and the problem was quickly resolved.</p>\n<p>Trump’s maximum pressure campaign, by contrast, has got Iran to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/30353bd0f0494522b9f5753e23f3f9b9?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=AP\">threaten to <em>expand </em></a>its nuclear program and, at least according to the White House, increase hostile and destabilizing behavior in the Persian Gulf by repeatedly attacking ships and tankers. Pompeo even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jwcglaser/status/1140473932056862722?s=20\">inadvertently admitted this</a> in an interview with CBS on Sunday: he said that the maximum pressure campaign is intended to make Iran behave like a “normal” friendly nation, but admitted that the reason Iran is disrupting oil shipments through the Gulf (allegedly) is because the U.S. sanctions regime has tried to zero-out Iranian oil exports. Our allies in Europe and Asia continue to oppose the White House’s policy, while China continues to purchase Iranian oil exports in spite of U.S. sanctions. This approach has borne no fruit. Ideally, President Trump would take this opportunity as an inflection point and shift to a posture that at least offers Iran an achievable and face-saving diplomatic off-ramp to this unrelenting pressure. </p>\n', '2019-06-21 13:31:00', '2019-06-22 20:36:39', '2019-06-22 20:36:39'),

When I returned two years ago I flew in sitting next to a Brit who was on his third tourist trip. He was planning a helicopter flight over the capital of Pyongyang, which would have been inconceivable only a few years ago.</p>\n<p>However, the country remains mysterious, even inscrutable, to most American policymakers.

Aimed at providing Secretary Pompeo “with fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation’s founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” the commission has raised several concerns. Chief among them is whether “natural law” is code, signaling that the department in future might “focus less on protecting women and LGBT people,” as put by <em><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/human-rights-state-department-1348014\">Politico</a></em>, which broke the story on Thursday afternoon. </p>\n<p>Giving weight to those concerns, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-dept-panel-redefine-human-rights-based-natural/story?id=63400485\">ABC News</a> late Friday reported that, according to a source familiar with the plans for the commission, Princeton’s Robbie George has played a prominent role in its creation. I’ve known Prof. George for some time now. He’s a first-rate scholar and advocate for religious liberty. In fact, he spoke at Cato’s 2016 <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/events/protecting-religious-liberty\">conference on religious liberty</a>, which we memorialized with our book <em><a href=\"https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/policy-report/2017/9/cpr-v39n5-7.pdf\">Deep Commitments</a></em>. But as co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage and a prominent voice in Catholic circles, he has long argued against the gay-rights agenda, especially same-sex marriage.</p>\n<p>If this is the course the commission takes, this “fresh thinking about human rights” could seriously complicate the work of the department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, especially in countries with draconian anti-gay laws and practices. But at a theoretical level too, as noted in my earlier post, the promise this “fresh thinking” raises for correcting some of the misconceptions that afflict today’s rights talk could easily be lost by coupling natural law and religious belief. A word is in order on that matter. </p>\n<p>Start with this: Natural <em>law</em> and natural <em>rights</em> are not the same thing. True, natural rights emerged historically from natural law. And in the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson did speak of our rights as being “endowed by [our] Creator.” But that was a very general invocation, suited properly for “a candid World” wherein was found a variety of beliefs. Properly understood, however, especially as modern natural rights theory has evolved, our rights are <em>not</em> grounded in a prescriptive natural law, much less in any belief system, religious or otherwise, but in universal human reason, as John Locke and many of the Founders understood. They saw that liberty—the right to pursue happiness by our own subjective lights—was the very essence of natural rights. </p>\n<p>Thus, on this understanding, natural rights are not derived from natural law. On the contrary, natural law—the rules suited to securing our logically prior natural rights—is derived from those rights. In fact, if you look at the famous second paragraph of the Declaration, that’s exactly the order you’ll find. Jefferson sets forth the moral vision first, defined by our natural rights; only then does he set forth the political and legal order—the <em>law</em>—that is “instituted among Men” to secure those rights. </p>\n<p>Historically, of course, many have associated natural law with, and grounded it on, religious beliefs, and many still do, although the ancient Greeks, especially the Stoics, and Roman Law did not so ground it. But the American founding emerged from the Enlightenment—English, Scottish, and continental—and so is best understood as having eschewed an undue reliance on theological considerations—though I grant that on that historical question it’s a mixed record, despite the <em>theory</em> of the matter. </p>\n<p>As a <em>practical</em> matter, however, it would be far better if this commission emphasized natural rights and the nation’s founding principles rather than natural law, because the former does not carry what many today see, not without reason, as the “baggage” of the latter. I presume that we all want a world that respects <em>liberty</em>, including religious liberty, not one that restricts our freedoms. That is what animated us at Cato’s Center for Constitutional Studies as the same-sex cases were coming along. Thus, we filed amicus briefs with the Supreme Court defending, on equal protection grounds, <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/publications/legal-briefs/obergefell-v-hodges\">the liberty of same-sex couples to marry</a> and, after that, <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/publications/legal-briefs/masterpiece-cakeshop-v-colorado-civil-rights-commission\">the liberty of bakers</a> and others, on religious freedom grounds, to decline to participate in various ways in same-sex weddings. In both cases, the principle was the same—liberty. </p>\n<p>As I intimated in Friday’s post, albeit with a focus on aberrations that have arisen from modern “<em>human</em> rights” thinking, this commission, properly staffed and conducted, affords an opportunity to redirect our public debate to America’s first principles—and to do so on many issues. Given the state of liberty today around the world, the concerns raised so far about this commission should be seen not as something to be countered but to be embraced. There will be close calls, to be sure, and some differences. But in the end, those raising the concerns and those calling for fresh thinking should be focused on the same thing—the liberty that natural rights are all about. </p>\n', '2019-06-03 19:37:00', '2019-06-22 20:36:39', '2019-06-22 20:36:39'),

Germany and other countries <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/world/europe/merkel-speech-munich.html\">flatly refused</a>.  In April, Washington exacerbated already serious transatlantic frictions when it eliminated some of the boycott waivers it had granted to EU firms.  Allied governments <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/eu-germany-france-britain-express-concerns-on-us-sanctions-action/29921178.html\">sharply criticized</a>  that step and Washington’s other moves to tighten sanctions.  Iran soon stated that it would no longer abide by some JCPOA provisions and might <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iran-nuclear-deal-war-uranium-weapons-trump-us-a8903966.html\">resume</a> enriching uranium. Tehran’s response confirmed some of the worst European apprehension about the probable consequences of Washington’s strategy.</p>\n\n<!--break-->\n\n<p>European leaders also resent growing U.S. pressure on them to embrace a policy they oppose.  When Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a surprise visit to Brussels in early May as EU foreign ministers met to discuss the escalating crisis about the Iran nuclear agreement, <a href=\"https://lobelog.com/pompeo-gets-cold-shouldered-on-iran-in-brussels/\">his reception</a> was <a href=\"https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/world/europe/2019-05-13-exasperated-europeans-face-surprise-pompeo-visit-on-iran/\">midpoint between cool and frigid</a>.</p>\n\n<p>What little international support the Trump administration continues to receive for its Iran policy comes from Israel, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/america-allies-iran-rivals-war-action-saudi-arabia-uae-israel-1439240\">Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates</a>, and Tehran’s other longtime adversaries in the Middle East.  But that support is clearly motivated by cynical, self-serving concerns.  Israel would like the United States to weaken, if not eliminate, a major geopolitical nemesis.  Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies are pursuing a policy of regional hegemony, and Iran is the principal obstacle to that goal.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Washington has blindly served as an enabler for Riyadh’s policies. To America’s everlasting shame, that support (under both the Obama and Trump administrations) has included active military assistance to the Saudi-led war in Yemen against Tehran’s supposed Houthi allies.  That war has included <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/trump-veto-yemen/587332/\">numerous</a> Saudi <a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/stop-the-destruction-of-yemen/\">war crimes</a>.  Although the European allies thus far have refrained from publicly denouncing Washington’s policy in Yemen, most of them clearly are uneasy about it.</p>\n\n<p>A government finding itself alone in pursuing a policy is not necessarily evidence of error.  Minority perspectives sometimes prove to be right and majority perspectives spectacularly wrong.  But Washington’s Iran policy is not one of those cases.  The Trump administration’s approach has been counterproductive and is becoming increasingly dangerous.  Most of Washington’s allies recognize the extent of the folly, and U.S. officials would be wise to listen to their observations and objections.</p>\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/file_attach/hubspot-cta-button-area.css\" /><section role=\"article\" about=\"/node/308551\" class=\"node node-type-embed-promo\"><header><h2><span>Related content</span> </h2>\n                </header><div class=\"promo_content\">\n    <h1><em>\n<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-ec5e731e-4186-47cd-8594-5f070daeb0ac\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-ec5e731e-4186-47cd-8594-5f070daeb0ac\" id=\"hs-cta-ec5e731e-4186-47cd-8594-5f070daeb0ac\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"></div><![endif]--><a href=\"https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/4957480/ec5e731e-4186-47cd-8594-5f070daeb0ac\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-ec5e731e-4186-47cd-8594-5f070daeb0ac\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" src=\"https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/download-remote-images/no-cache.hubspot.com/81979052289/ec5e731e-4186-47cd-8594-5f070daeb0ac.png\" alt=\"Trump and Iran: Deal or No Deal? \" /></a></span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://js.hscta.net/cta/current.js\"></script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n<!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--\n hbspt.cta.load(4957480, \'ec5e731e-4186-47cd-8594-5f070daeb0ac\', {}); \n//--><!]]>\n</script></span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n</em></h1>\n\n<!--<h3><div>Trump and Iran: Deal or No Deal?</div></h3>-->\n<p>We talk Trump and the future of the Iran nuclear deal with Colin Kahl, former national security adviser to Vice President Joe Biden.</p><p>\n</p></div>\n<footer><div>\n<!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-60b8322d-911d-4787-b6ca-5f2b5deef207\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-60b8322d-911d-4787-b6ca-5f2b5deef207\" id=\"hs-cta-60b8322d-911d-4787-b6ca-5f2b5deef207\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"></div><![endif]--><a href=\"https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/4957480/60b8322d-911d-4787-b6ca-5f2b5deef207\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-60b8322d-911d-4787-b6ca-5f2b5deef207\" style=\"border-width:0px;\" src=\"https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/download-remote-images/no-cache.hubspot.com/81979052289/60b8322d-911d-4787-b6ca-5f2b5deef207.png\" alt=\"Listen Here\" /></a></span><script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://js.hscta.net/cta/current.js\"></script><script type=\"text/javascript\">\n<!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!--\n hbspt.cta.load(4957480, \'60b8322d-911d-4787-b6ca-5f2b5deef207\', {}); \n//--><!]]>\n</script></span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code -->\n</div>\n</footer></section><!-- END HUBSPOT CTA -->', '2019-06-03 16:45:00', '2019-06-22 20:36:39', '2019-06-22 20:36:39');

But Bolton still has his job. Ironically enough, it turns out that the longtime “Apprentice” host is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/09/25/president-trump-is-afraid-fire-people/?utm_term=.96a4c95a3b2e\">gun-shy about firing people</a>.  </p>\n<p>Is there anything Congress can do about a rogue presidential appointee that the president won’t fire?

The answer turns on whether the National Security Advisor is one of the “civil Officers of the United States” to which <a href=\"http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/tocs/a1_2_5.html\">Article II, sec. 4</a> applies. The term isn’t defined in the Constitution, and there’s little precedent to go on, the House having impeached just one executive-branch official below the presidential level in 230 years: Gilded-Age Secretary of War <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/War_Secretarys_Impeachment_Trial.htm\">William Belknap</a>. As the Congressional Research Service <a href=\"https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R44260.html#_Toc433996055\">notes</a>, it’s something of an open question “whether Congress may impeach and remove subordinate, non-Cabinet level executive branch officials.” </p>\n<p>Still, the fact that Bolton, unlike a Cabinet secretary, doesn’t hold a <a href=\"http://dearcolleague.us/2018/03/require-senate-confirmation-of-the-national-security-advisor-3/\">Senate-confirmed position</a> is a technicality that shouldn’t protect him, especially when it’s clear—even <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-frustrated-trump-questions-his-administrations-venezuela-strategy/2019/05/08/ad51561a-71a7-11e9-9f06-5fc2ee80027a_story.html\">to the president</a>—that his recklessness might drag us into an unnecessary war. Impeachment arose in England as a means of striking ministers close to the Crown, including those who gave <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=UT0_MCzwRW4C&lpg=PA75&ots=hk_29IKcjb&dq=impeachment%20%22pernicious%20advice%20to%20the%20crown%22&pg=PA75#v=onepage&q=%22pernicious%20advice%20to%20the%20crown%22&f=false\">“pernicious” foreign policy advice</a>.

Historically, “any appointee whose continued service was so politically toxic as to provoke a serious effort at impeachment has been shuffled off the stage” when the president demands his or her resignation.</p>\n<p>A resolution to impeach Bolton, something any member of the House <a href=\"https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R44260.html#_Toc433996067\">could introduce</a>, might serve as the shot across the bow that convinces Trump it’s time to clean his own house. It needn’t make it to the floor to be effective: merely securing enough cosponsors could be enough. On the other hand, such a move might cause Trump to dig in his heels—with a president this mercurial it’s hard to tell.</p>\n<!--break--><p>However, there’s another way Congress can use the threat of impeachment to deter an illegal and unnecessary war. As I explained <a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/impeachment-should-be-on-the-table-if-trump-bombs-iran/\">in the <em>American Conservative</em></a> last week, the House could pass a <a href=\"https://www.house.gov/the-house-explained/the-legislative-process/bills-resolutions\">simple resolution</a> “expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the use of offensive military force against Iran without prior and clear authorization of an Act of Congress constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under article II, section 4 of the Constitution.” </p>\n<p>The  <a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article225147640.html\">late, great Rep. Walter Jones</a> (R-NC) proposed <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/03/a-resolution-to-impeach-is-ready-if-obama-goes-to-war-without-congress/254366/\">a similar measure</a> in President Obama’s second term, when the administration publicly contemplated airstrikes on Syria. Jones introduced <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/107/text\">a concurrent resolution</a> stating that “except in response to an actual or imminent attack against the territory of the United States, the use of offensive military force by a President without prior and clear authorization of an Act of Congress” is an impeachable offense. The Jones resolution only secured a handful of cosponsors and proved unnecessary when President Obama decided to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/world/middleeast/syria.html\">seek congressional authorization</a> for airstrikes, then <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-23876085\">abandoned the effort</a> entirely. </p>\n<p>Last summer, Jones and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) revived the idea of pre-defining unauthorized warmaking as an impeachable offense. On the theory that “the law should warn before it strikes,” <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-resolution/922/text\">House Resolution 922</a> defined undeclared wars as high crimes and misdemeanors under Article II, section 4. Constitutional lawyer <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/constitutional-lawyer-bruce-fein-effort-stop-presidential-wars/\">Bruce Fein</a>, who originally proposed the idea and helped draft the bill, described its chances of passing as “remote in the short run. Its immediate purpose is to spark a public and congressional debate about war powers.” </p>\n<p>The prospect of war with Iran ought to be <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/05/14/conflict-with-iran-would-not-be-like-iraq-war-itd-be-worse/?utm_term=.e902d76cda8e\">all the spark that’s needed</a>. As Gabbard recently noted, the conflict Bolton covets would make the Iraq War “<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rep-gabbard-tells-tucker-carlson-war-with-iran-would-be-devastating\">look like a cakewalk</a>—[it] would take far more American lives, it would cost more civilian lives across the region.”</p>\n<p>The current House leadership fears that an impeachment drive would be a “divisive” distraction. Instead, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-democrats-fall-in-line-with-pelosis-no-impeachment-strategydespite-trumps-defiance/2019/05/15/ce888e1a-7725-11e9-b3f5-5673edf2d127_story.html?utm_term=.4969dc1df273\">told House Democrats</a> last week, “we need to show [voters] that we are doing all of these other things that they care about so much” (whatever those are). Pelosi <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/would-democrats-really-face-a-backlash-if-they-impeached-trump/\">may be right</a> to worry about the political costs of an all-consuming impeachment effort in the run-up to the 2020 election. But a resolution along the lines proposed by Jones and Gabbard doesn’t open an impeachment inquiry. It wouldn’t distract and shouldn’t divide–unless one considers it “divisive” for Congress to defend <a href=\"https://oll.libertyfund.org/quotes/236\">its core prerogatives</a> and head off an illegal war.  </p>\n<p>True, a sense of the House resolution wouldn’t have the force of law: it’s a mere statement of intent by the members who sign on. But it could serve as fair warning to the president, and a precommitment device for the House: a public pledge to take action should the administration cross the line. In politics as in war, deterrence sometimes requires a credible threat.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n', '2019-05-29 15:25:00', '2019-06-22 20:36:39', '2019-06-22 20:36:39'),
(379, 13, 'A Left-Right Alliance to Stop the Forever Wars – Led by Veterans', 'https://www.cato.org/blog/left-right-alliance-stop-forever-wars-led-veterans', '<p>Earlier this week, over 50 veterans of America’s seemingly endless wars <a title=\"Conservative and liberal veterans groups launch lobbying campaign to end the \'forever wars\'\" href=\"https://taskandpurpose.com/cva-votevets-forever-war\" target=\"_blank\">fanned out across Capitol Hill</a> to make the case for ending these wars. The organizers of the initiative, VoteVets and Concerned Veterans for America (CVA), have been on opposite sides on many issues. But, as the <em><a title=\"Two Veterans Groups, Left and Right, Join Forces Against the Forever Wars\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/us/politics/vote-vets-concerned-veterans-america.html\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times</a></em> reported earlier this year, they’ve come together to call on members of Congress to take responsibility, and revisit the nearly 18-year-old Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) passed immediately after 9/11.</p>\n<p>CVA’s Dan Caldwell explains in a new <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkRcLGXZHFM&feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> that the groups’ members share “a common bond through military service.” Both groups would now like to see Congress “use the powers given to it in the Constitution to help America pursue a more restrained foreign policy.”</p>\n<p>VoteVets’ chairman Jon Soltz agrees. “If there’s a national security threat, and its debated in Congress, there’s reasons for military action. But we’ve exhausted those reasons in many places that we’re currently fighting in the world.”</p>\n<p>“It’s our job as activists,” he continues, “to identify where Congress is negligent and begin to establish paths forward, and create political repercussions for people that don’t want to do their job.”</p>\n<p>Some members of Congress aren’t shirking their responsibilities. At a luncheon on Wednesday hosted by CVA, <a title=\"Paul, Udall introduce bill to end Afghanistan War\" href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/432681-paul-udall-introduce-bill-to-end-afghanistan-war\" target=\"_blank\">Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) pointed to the bill that he has co-sponsored with Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)</a>, that calls for the removal of all U.S. troops from Afghanistan and the formal repeal of the post-9/11 AUMF. He was followed at the lectern by three members of Congress who agreed that the wars had gone on too long, and with too little oversight. Rep. Max Rose (D-NY), a former Army Ranger and decorated combat veteran, bemoaned the country’s addiction to undeclared war. Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH), another former Ranger, pointed to the nation’s soaring deficit, and questioned the lack of accountability. And Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) pushed back on the “war lobby’s” seemingly endless appetite for still more foreign conflicts. Other speakers included retired Maj. Gen. Paul Eaton, who has worked with VoteVets since 2006, the Charles Koch Foundation’s William Ruger, a U.S. Navy reservist and veteran of the war in Afghanistan, and Rachel Bovard of Defense Priorities.</p>\n<p>When I spoke to Caldwell by phone after the event, he explained that, in the past, CVA had mostly focused on reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse within the Department to Defense. But, they realized “you can’t have an honest conversation about both departments without talking about our foreign policy.”</p>\n<!--break--><p>\nBecause foreign policy ultimately drives military spending, and because CVA has always stressed that the national debt is America’s greatest long-term threat, he and others within the organizations decided to focus additional attention on the assumptions driving U.S. foreign policy, and to question the logic of America’s endless wars.</p>\n<p>Members and their staffs were surprised to see VoteVets and CVA working together. Many were receptive to the message, but others worry that repealing the 2001 AUMF, or replacing it with something more limited, would tie the hands of the military and intelligence agencies, and increase our exposure to future terrorist incidents.</p>\n<p>But research shows that military intervention is a poor tool for fighting terrorism – indeed, the presence of large numbers of foreign troops, or anger and resentment at destruction raining down from the sky, may create more terrorists than it kills. It is long past time to <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/step-back-lessons-us-foreign-policy-failed-war-terror\" target=\"_blank\">take a step back</a>, and explore other approaches. More to the point, the <a title=\"Public Opinion and Counterterrorism Policy\" href=\"https://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/public-opinion-counterterrorism-policy\" target=\"_blank\">fear of terrorism</a> should no longer serve as the central organizing principle of America’s foreign policy, given that the <em>actual</em> danger it poses to Americans is modest and manageable.  </p>\n<p>And, as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/opinion/repeal-replace-trump-war-powers.html\" target=\"_blank\">Gene Healy and John Glaser pointed out</a> last year, AUMF repeal “wouldn’t leave the executive branch legally hamstrung” should circumstances change. “The president would still retain independent constitutional power to ‘<a href=\"http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/madison-the-debates-on-the-adoption-of-the-federal-constitution-vol-5#Elliot_1314-05_3937\" target=\"_blank\">repel sudden attacks</a>’ in case of an imminent threat” and if President Trump decides that a particular organization “represents a serious, long-term danger to our national security, he is free to make that case to the people’s representatives and secure authorization for war.”</p>\n<p>Caldwell suspects that Congress’s reluctance is driven more by politics than by objective concerns for the nation’s security. “Most members don’t want to take political risks around tough foreign policy issues,” he told me. But he believes that “VoteVets and CVA can provide cover for members on both sides, particularly on repeal of the 2001 AUMF, which will ultimately lead to a more restrained foreign policy.”</p>\n<p>And he assured me that this was just the beginning. “This partnership is not just a flash in the pan.”</p>\n<p>That seems clear. At the tail end of their joint video, Soltz poses a direct question to us all – but especially to VoteVets and CVA members, and to the members of Congress who actually have the power to implement real change: “Everybody here knows what’s right or wrong. Everybody here knows they want to end the war. The only question is, ‘Do you have the courage to do it?’”</p>\n<p> </p>\n', '2019-05-24 12:26:00', '2019-06-22 20:36:39', '2019-06-22 20:36:39'),
(380, 13, 'Memorial Day Thoughts', 'https://www.cato.org/blog/memorial-day-thoughts', '<p>Benjamin Franklin said, “There never was a good war or a bad peace.” Given Franklin’s leadership in the struggle for American independence, we can infer that he did not think that there never was a war that was necessary, or a war that was worth its cost. But he reminds us that even necessary wars have terrible costs.</p>\n<p>I thought about Franklin when I read an eloquent <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704596504575272732097688358\">column</a> on the meaning of Memorial Day by the novelist Mark Helprin, who is also a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute. He lamented:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Though if by and large we ignore the debt we owe to those who fell at Saratoga, Antietam, the Marne, the Pointe du Hoc, and a thousand other places and more, our lives and everything we value are the ledger in which it is indelibly recorded.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It’s a worthy sentiment, one heard frequently in Memorial Day addresses, and we do indeed owe our lives and our pursuit of happiness to the freedom that America’s soldiers have sometimes had to defend.</p>\n<p>But I can’t help wondering: Have <em>all</em> of America’s wars have been necessary to American freedom? Helprin mentioned the Second Battle of the Marne, the great turning point of World War I and the first battle in which Americans started experiencing the enormous casualties that Europeans had been facing for nearly four years. The problem is that World War I was <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/policy-report/mayjune-2014/woodrow-wilsons-great-mistake\">a catastrophe</a>, a foolish and unnecessary war, a war of European potentates that both England and the United States could have stayed out of but that became indeed a World War, the Great War. In our own country, the war gave us economic planning, conscription, nationalization of the railroads, a sedition act, confiscatory income tax rates, and prohibition. Internationally, World War I and its conclusion led directly to the Bolshevik revolution, the rise of National Socialism, World War II, and the Cold War. World War I was the worst mistake of the 20th century, the mistake that set in motion all the tragedies of the century. The deaths of those who fell at the Marne are all the more tragic when we reflect that they did not in fact serve to protect our lives and all that we value.</p>\n<p>Did the wars in Vietnam and Iraq protect American lives and liberties? In 2015 Republican presidential contender Jeb Bush <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/241966-jeb-bush-iraq-war-questions-a-disservice-to-troops\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> that discussing whether the Iraq war was a mistake “does a disservice to a lot of people who sacrificed a lot.” It’s understandable that an aspiring commander-in-chief would want to spare the feelings of those who lost a loved one in Iraq. But surely it’s more important that a commander-in-chief ask tough questions about when it’s advisable to go to war, a point voters should keep in mind over the next 18 months.</p>\n<p>In my book <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/libertarianmind\">The Libertarian Mind</a>, I wrote about the effects of war: not just death on a large scale but the destruction of families, businesses, and civil society. And thus:</p>\n<blockquote><p>War cannot be avoided at all costs, but it should be avoided wherever possible. Proposals to involve the United States—or any government—in foreign conflict should be treated with great skepticism….We should understand the consequences of war for our entire social order and thus go to war only when absolutely necessary.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On this weekend we should mourn those who went to war, such as my father, who planned and participated in the liberation of Europe, and his brother who was lost off the coast of Normandy, and we should resolve not to risk American lives in the future except when our vital national interests are at stake.</p>\n', '2019-05-24 10:03:00', '2019-06-22 20:36:39', '2019-06-22 20:36:39'),
